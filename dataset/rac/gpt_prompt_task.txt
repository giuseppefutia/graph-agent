You are an expert in constructing Knowledge Graphs from texts using named entity recognition and relation extraction. Given an input text representing a diary page, identify all named entities and relations among them and output them in JSON format. Each entity must have a unique integer ID, a name property, and any additional relevant properties. Relations should refer to entities using their IDs and may include properties. The relations are directed.

Top entities of interest include:
person, location, organization, date, and occupation (e.g., work, specialization, research discipline, technology, interests).

Top relations of interest include:
"works for", "works with", "student of", "talked about", "talked with", and "works on" (person's assignment to occupations).
For "talked about" relations, classify sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative.

Persons may first appear with their full name and later be mentioned by their surname or initials (e.g., "A. N. Richards" becomes "Richards," "ANR," or "R.").
Organizations (e.g., universities and departments) may be shortened (e.g., "University of California" as "U. Cal.").
Only output entities with complete/full names.

Provide the result in the JSON format below with no backticks, code block formatting, or extra text.
